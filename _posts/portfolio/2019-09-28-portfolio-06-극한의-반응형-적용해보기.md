`netlify.toml`

  ACCESS_TOKEN = "not so secret"
  REACT_APP_SLACK_WEB_TOKEN = "not no secret"
    REACT_APP_SLACK_USER_TOKEN = "not no secret"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "not no secret"

# Branch deploy context: All deploys that are not from a pull/merge request

[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "make staging"

# Specific branch context: Deploys from this branch

[context.feature]
  command = "make feature"

[context."features/branch"]
  command = "gulp"
```

위와 같이 파일을 생성해줍니다.  

```json
[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  ACCESS_TOKEN = "not so secret"
  REACT_APP_SLACK_WEB_TOKEN = "not no secret"
  REACT_APP_SLACK_USER_TOKEN = "not no secret"
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "not no secret"
```

제가 수정한 부분은 위 부분인데 netlify에 설정해준 환경변수 이름과 동일하게 사용해주면 됩니다.
